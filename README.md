# SurVis - Clustering Evaluation Methods Literature Browser

![Screenshot](doc/survis.png)

This is an interactive visual literature browser powered by **SurVis** to support my COMP4037 Coursework 3 (Research Methods) at the University of Nottingham.  
The topic of this review is **"Methods for Selecting the Number of Clusters (k) in Clustering"**, with a particular focus on **visual evaluation metrics**, such as **silhouette score**, **elbow method**, and **gap statistic**.

ðŸ“š The goal of this SurVis interface is to:

- Organize and categorize 10 academic research papers related to k selection in clustering
- Enable easy browsing, filtering, and analysis of evaluation strategies
- Complement my 2000-word abridged literature review submission
